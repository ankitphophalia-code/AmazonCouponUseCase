# AmazonCouponUseCase
A ML use case to determine the probability of acceptance of a coupon what depending on several characteristics

I did an analysis of two types of coupon "bar" and "Restaurant(20-50)". After reviewing the data from different perspective, i observed very similar charactiersitcis in terms of the type of drivers accepting or rejecting the coupon. 

I have provided a detailed analysis of all my observation in the Jupyter notebook but here is the summary of my findindgs clubbed together for both the coupons :
====================================================================================================================================================================
1. People who has visits bar or restaurant less frequently tends to accept the coupon more often.
2. Acceptance rate is higer amonth the Drivers who are above 25 years old compare to younger dirvers.
3. Drivers with Kids as passengers has less then 1% chance to accept the coupon
4. "bar" coupon is more famous among "Students" in contrast to "Expensive restaurant" coupon where the most acceptance rate is with occupation "Computer and Mathematical "
